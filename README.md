# AutoTomb
![autotomb Unity screencap](https://github.com/Cook4986/AutoTomb/blob/main/autotombScreencap.png)
Takes [Digital Giza tomb page](http://giza.fas.harvard.edu/sites/532/full/) and returns a set of AI (Meshy) generated 3D models corresponding to contemporaneous (i.e., ancient Egyptian) object references mentioned in early 20th century excavation diaries. The notebook also returns a log of all prompts, local outputs, and X,Y,Z coordinates for placing the model set in 3D space, including in downstream XR environments. Finally, there's a separate, C# script (ArtifactCloudGenerator.cs) that generates rotating "object clouds" of all tomb models at Unity at runtime. AutoTomb is a targeted fork/refactor of [Longhand](https://github.com/Cook4986/Longhand), which was designed to help humanities researchers navigate and comprehend opaque text corpora by exposing them to the benefits of immersive visualization like depth cues and embodiment.
